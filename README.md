**'Hi 🙋🏻‍♀️ I'm Corina, junior software developer creating my own version of digital world step by step'**

Once upon a time, only two years back, a magical world of codes captivated me! Imagine a treasure hunt with secret symbols and secret rules, and that's what coding felt like. 🏴‍☠️

In my business learning land (BSc Business and Marketing), during year two, a grand surprise was planned for someone special – a digital card made by...ME !!! But guess what? The surprise was on me! I found out that I could create it using simple things like making shapes with magic words (HTML), painting colors (CSS), and making things come to life (JavaScript). ✨

And from that moment on, a new journey began! Problem-solving became my happy game, where I'd solve puzzles rather than create chaos (just kidding, I still love mischief 😂). Sometimes, I'd even ignore fun invites from friends to watch silly videos and instead hop on a magical broomstick to learn new spells in JavaScript! I can't help it; I'm enchanted by its powers, and I'm not sorry at all! 😄

So, my dear friends, if you can't find me sometimes, fear not! I'm just lost in this fantastical world of coding, where every bug I catch is like catching a mischievous pixie, and every code I write is like weaving a spell. It's fun, it's wild, and it's a world where imagination runs wild with joy! 🧙‍♀️🌈
