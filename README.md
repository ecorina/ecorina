Hi üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm Corina, junior software developer creating my own version of digital world step by step. I love technology and I am always eager to learn new things. I enjoy solving problems and I am good at organizing projects. I'm adaptable, motivated, and resourceful and I have a curious mind. I believe in doing my best to make a positive impact in the world of technology.

In my spare time I play Squash, go rollerblading long distances (or at least this is what my Strava app says üòÖ),I like to paint and I bake the most delicios sponge cakes ü•∞.

Fun Fact: I got into coding by creating a Valentine's Day digital card. What started as a simple gesture of affection turned into a captivating journey of discovery and learning.

Fact about me that surprises people: I'm an introvert but I act like an extrovert.(INTP-A)
